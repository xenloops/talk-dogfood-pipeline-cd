# Conclusions and Lessons Learned

* Installing and updating Jenkins is easy
* Installing and integrating other tools less so
* Rolling your own pipeline means you own it, and maintain it
* Many open-source tools are not the easiest to implement
* Documentation sometimes lags behind the software
* Legacy and novel forms of help might not be that helpful, e.g.:
  * StackOverflow posts may be too specific and may not match your use case
  * ChatGPT gives outdated guidance, especially for code

But...
* You do get to say "We built this"
* And at low/no cost of tooling
* You can always reach maintainers with bug reports/feature requests
* SaaS/Cloud implementations can provide headaches as well
  * Budget for vendor professional services
