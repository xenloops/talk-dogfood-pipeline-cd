# Deployment

Finally, the meat of the action.

We have:

* Code in a repo
* Secrets that we need to keep secret
* 

## Now, let's put them together!

<br /><br /><br /><br />

### Prerequisites

From last year's talk:

* [Install Jenkins](https://github.com/xenloops/talk-dogfood-pipeline-ci/blob/main/jenkins.md)
* [Install Dependency-Check (for SCA)](https://github.com/xenloops/talk-dogfood-pipeline-ci/blob/main/sca.md)
* [Install SonarQube (for SAST)](https://github.com/xenloops/talk-dogfood-pipeline-ci/blob/main/sast.md)
* [Create the pipeline as code (for best results)](https://github.com/xenloops/talk-dogfood-pipeline-ci/blob/main/pipe_as_code_2.md)

<br /><br /><br /><br />

### Add a secret

* Before, just grabbed a copy of the code
* What if we need to check it out?
